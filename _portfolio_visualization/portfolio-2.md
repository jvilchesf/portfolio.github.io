# Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide an overview of project completion for an environmental company, where most of the projects are related to bird or mammal survey site assessments. The aim is to ensure the installation of windmills poses no risk to the local fauna.

To achieve this, I created a Looker Studio dashboard that clearly displays the percentage of each project that has been completed and what remains to be done. This helps prioritize efforts on tasks that are delayed or urgent and effectively measure time.

At that time, the team responsible for tracking project completion was using Excel for this task, which required a manual weekly effort to compile the necessary information. This is why the primary goal was to automate this process and ensure the consistent use of the dashboard.


## Tools and technologies
* To approach this project I used:
    * Python: Using the requests and pandas libraries, I successfully retrieved from a public repository, got geo coordinates and structured the data.
    * Tableau: Using Tableau I created a dashboard to show the data already structured.
    
3. Tools and Technologies
	List of tools, programming languages, libraries, and platforms used (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, Tableau, Power BI, etc.).

4. Dataset Description
Source: Origin of the dataset (e.g., Kaggle, NYC Open Data, client-provided, etc.).
Size and Structure: Number of rows/columns, data types, and key features.
Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean, transform, or augment the data.

5. Methodology
Data Visualization Workflow:
Data exploration (tools and steps used).
Charts/visuals created and their relevance (e.g., heatmaps, line graphs, dashboards).
Deep Learning Workflow:
Model selection (e.g., CNN, RNN, GANs).
Architecture and parameters (layers, optimizers, loss functions).
Training and validation (epochs, metrics like accuracy or RMSE).

6. Challenges and Solutions
Challenges: Issues faced during the project (e.g., data imbalance, overfitting).
Solutions: How you addressed these issues (e.g., data augmentation, cross-validation).

7. Results and Insights
Data Visualization: Key findings and their implications.
Deep Learning: Model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy score, loss curve).
Include screenshots of dashboards or plots to showcase your work visually.

8. Impact
Describe how your work benefited the client/stakeholders or solved the problem.
Quantify results if possible (e.g., “Improved prediction accuracy by 20%”).
